Good Day,

My name is Jon.  I don't really know how to blog.  Heck, I don't even really use Facebook.  I'm just a Web Developer with not quite enough experience and not quite enough knowledge to make it a real living yet.  I've read around town that a Developer of the Web variety is often encouraged to write a blog app as one of their early projects.  I've tried that once before with limited success, but as we are always learning and growing, I'd like to give it another try.  I have recently been learning the use of Ruby and Python, but I think I will stick to good ol' PHP for this app.  So far, I know my blog posts should include an author name in case they are reprinted off site, a title of the post, a date of the post, and the post itself.  I haven't decided if I want to limit images to one per post or allow some form of image insertion in the post itself.
